## About this Project

Creating a PHP Laravel app to pull wiki data for interactive visualizations.

This is derived from the following lesson: https://dev.to/kingsconsult/how-to-consume-restful-apis-in-laravel-8-and-laravel-7-4gii

I need to figure out how to update between the last lesson and this, without using the preprapared github repo. . .
